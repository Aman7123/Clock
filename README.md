# Clock
A clock application that I made to solve the problem where prior to Windows 10 if you had multiple monitors it only showed the Time and Date on the main monitor. If you are a gamer or use fullscreen applications you cant access the clock easily or without switching window focus.

My clock application has the following features:
==================

1.A XML file generator and parser that lets your preferances be saved.
2.Carful attention to detail including the promise that on the last second of the year if the clock is open the year will properly update.
3.An auto-update feature if I every update this in the future.
IMPORTANT!! :
4.An IP and computer spec collector that is logged to my database. HOWEVER the server nor that ip address are in my possession anymore.
