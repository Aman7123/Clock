Clock
===============
A clock application that I made to solve the problem where prior to Windows 10 if you had multiple monitors it only showed the Time and Date on the main monitor. If you are a gamer or use fullscreen applications you cant access the clock easily or without switching window focus.

My clock application has the following features:
==================
  * A XML file generator and parser that lets your preferances be saved.
  * Carful attention to detail including the promise that on the last second of the year if the clock is open the year will properly update.
  * An auto-update feature if I every update this in the future.
  <p>
IMPORTANT!! :
 </p>
  * An IP and computer spec collector that is logged to my database. HOWEVER the server nor that ip address are in my possession anymore.

Dependencies
============
  * [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/ "json-simple") (The version I originally used is 1.1.1)
  * [Apache Commons Codec](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/ "commons-codec") (The version I originally used is 1.9)
